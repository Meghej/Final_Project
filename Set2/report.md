**Results** : We obtained a accuracy of 99.75% which is quite good, the used algorithm was Decision Tree. For cross validation, since random forest takes care of it automatically we confirmed the results and they are matching. 

**Reason for choosing Decision Tree** : Given in the problem statement. 

**Problems faced** : Downloading the dataset, it was not present in the given link, it took time to search for it on thier own website, but finally found it. 

**Conculsion** : We can conclude that, with analysing dataset on the basis of transaction amount between 2 quaters, taking their ratios basically, we can predict a good level of credit card attrition activity. The larger the difference between expenditure between 2 quaters, the more the fluctuations in the attrition (inversely proportional).
